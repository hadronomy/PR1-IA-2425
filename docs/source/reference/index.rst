================

The **API Reference** provides a detailed information on public functions, classes, and methods of the project.
In this page each method/class is categorized by their functionality and connection to either uninformed or
informed search algorithms.

        Uninformed Search Algorithms
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The uninformed search algorithms are a set of algorithms that do not use any domain-specific knowledge to find the solution.
        These algorithms are used when the search space is not known or when the search space is too large to explore exhaustively.

        Informed Search Algorithms
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        The informed search algorithms are a set of algorithms that use domain-specific knowledge to find the solution.
        These algorithms are used when the search space is known and when the search space is small enough to explore exhaustively.
